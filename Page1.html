          <p> Dr. Dubey has been the whole and sole of the organization earning his Doctorate degree in the year 2009. With his hardwork and continuous efforts,
            he rose the organization's graph towards success over the years. His knowledge and skills combined with the practicalities of everyday life,
            makes even a subject like "Chemistry" fun to learn. Carrying an expertise of more than 30 years in CHEMISTRY, Dr. Dubey is amongst those few teachers
            in town, who are old are their teachings are like gold!
            He started teaching Chemistry when not many people were even aware of the concept of "Chemistry Coaching Classes" and with students securing
            well in their schools and competitive exams, his popularity rose. He believes in the concept of "The more you share your knowledge with others,
            the more it grows". Besides being a chemistry teacher, he is also a very good motivator and listens and solves the problems of his students
            with utmost patience and calm.
            Dr Dubey himself says that chemistry is in everyday life, from inside the cells in our bodies to the whole big universe, everything has parts of
            chemistry involved and the more you observe, the better you understand it!
