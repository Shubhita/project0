"# project0" 


For Project0, I have created a website for an imaginary "Chemistry Classes" and the use of any names, marks, grades, numbers or addresses 
has no real-life relevance to any person.

The website has "Page1.html" as the first page which contains a brief introduction about the classes and the director of the class.


"Page2.html" describes about the awards and achievements received by the director of the classes and lists some of the shining stars(students)
selected into some of the top universities or working with some of the top companies across the globe, along with their year of selection.




"Page3.html" has semi-blurred images of handwritten and printed notes as well as question-papers provided to students in the classes.




"Page4.html" gives the contact details- mobile and landline numbers with the address of classes and google map location.
